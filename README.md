# ViosMaps - Vector Interactive OpenSource Maps

## Synopsis

**ViosMaps** is a humble development aimed to the creation and rendering of vector maps divided into regions (created using the **SVG language**), setting metadata and managing interactions in an easy way. 

## Real Examples

## Dependencies

* It uses the great [Snap.SVG](http://snapsvg.io) library.

## Motivation

The project started as a humble attempt to render and manage interactions with each region or province for the maps of Italy and Argentina. 

The idea behind opensourcing **ViosMaps** is to teamwork with developers around the world to share ideas and knowledge, generalize the codebase (by better modularization) and add many great functionalities we can discuss. It would be very nice if we also write good documentation encouraging more developers to use this resource as a library  for their own projects.
