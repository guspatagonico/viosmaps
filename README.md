# viosMaps - Vector Interactive OpenSource Maps

## Synopsis

**viosMaps** is a humble attempt to render vector interactive maps based on SVG files. 

## Dependencies

* It uses the great [Snap.SVG](http://snapsvg.io) library.

## Motivation

The project started just to render and manage interactions for the maps of Italy and Argentina, but the idea behind opensourcing this code is to generalize and better modularize it, and in the best case, to add functionalities and write a good documentation to encourage others to use it.
