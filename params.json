It would be very nice if we also write good documentation encouraging more developers to use this resource as a library for their own projects.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n* [Gustavo Adrián Salvini](https://linkedin.com/in/gustavosalvini) - [@guspatagonico](http://twitter.com/guspatagonico)\r\n* [Darío Ruellan](http://linkedin.com/in/darioruellan) - [@druellan](http://twitter.com/druellan)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nAvailable under an [Apache 2 license](https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/Snap.svg/blob/master/LICENSE) which means it’s completely open-source, and completely free.",
